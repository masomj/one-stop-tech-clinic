  -This website is going to be the main online presence of the business "One Stop Tech Clinic". It will be replacing their facebook page as thier primary focus. Therefore, it needs to be responvie and accesible accross a range of devices, operating systems and screen sizes. It's goal is to bring in new customers for the computer repair business. So it needs to contain information about services that are offered, along with how to get them.

### User Experience (UX)
#### User Stories
#### First time Visitor Goals
  1. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to tell what services are offered soon after loading the website
  2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily and intuitivly navigate the website
  3. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to see evidence of the business's work
  4. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily and intuitivly contact the business in order to request a service

#### Returning Visitor Goals
  1. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to find the businesses contact information quickly
  2. As a returning visitor, i want to be able to see the businesses service guarantee / warranty policy

#### Design Process
-  ##### Colour Scheme
   - There are 4 main colours used throughout the site. That is Red, White, Dark Blue and Aqua blue. These colours were chosen as they are bright, bold colours that contrast well with each other. The inclusion of red buttons throughout the site was done as red is the colour that attracts the human eye the most, making the user immediately want to click it, increasing site engagement. 
  - #### Typography
   - As this site is aimed at providing information and attracting potential customers, an attractive and readable font called was "Fillfontnamehere" chosen. A backup font of Sans Serif was set to reduce the possibilty of an error resulting in the font defaulting to Times New Roman.
  - #### Imagery
   - The business already has an established social media page. So all imagery needed to be consistend with it, as some traffic may come from the social media pages. Mainly, the logo of the business, and the banner page had to be the same. The Hero image of the site is the same as the one used as a banner on the businesses facebook page. This is also true for the logo that sits in the top left corner of the Header, which also doubles as a home button. These images have releveant content and minimal, contrasting text which makes them appealing to the eye and perfect to greet a new site visitor and grab their attention.
    
### Wireframes
- home page mobile
- home page 1080p

### Technologies and Tools
- HTML
- CSS 
  - I decided to use HTML and CSS as they are the most modern and widely used programming languages in website development
- VS code
  - I decided to use VS Code instead of Gitpod or another cloud based editor so I can get experience using a desktop editor
- Balsamiq
  - To create the wireframe design's for the website
- Git and Github
  - I used Git to enact version control when producing my project, whilst using GitHub as the remote repository storage tool due to it's widespread industry usage.
  - I used Git via the command line in VS Code, though there is a GUI version available from GitHub, but as the industry standard is Command line, it is important to become profficent in Command line git before using the GUI version. 
### Testing
#### Code Validation
W3 Schools offer a code validation for both HTML and CSS. I ran all of my HTML pages and all CSS code through these. 
##### HTML Results
Link to img of each page's code test result
##### CSS Results

#### User Stories Testing
##### First Time Visitor

##### Returning Visitor

##### Device testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
##### Bugs
note any bugs still in the project / or some that were difficult to resolve
- links on nav bar wouldnt work - disucss changing file name from lc to uc
### Further functionality
As my skills in Javascript and other back end languages develop, I would like to implement further features such as a custom PC builder on the site, to allow users to create custom builds and provide the business with a configuration to then build. 
Additionally, I would like to implement a chat bot to speed up and increase the frequency of user interactions, with the goal of increasing custom for the business.
